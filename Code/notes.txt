for virtualenv instllation:
virtualenv -p python3 env

ACTIVATE VENV command:
source env/bin/activate


Autocomplete feature:
1. from input take a prefix = word_prefix for autocomplete() >>> POST METHOD
2. show top 5 results = starting_words 

3. pass chosen starting_word (need to copy paste to another form) to generate_sentence() >>> return the generated sentece and display it in home.html
4. everytime new word is input, the page should refresh and print new sentence. 

use ajax call for input box - calls to ur server on different route and provides autocomplete 
returns json >> update the DOM element. 

{% comment %} <div id="wordOptions"> {% endcomment %}
            {% comment %} 
                top 5 words will be displayed here
             {% endcomment %}
         
         {% comment %} </div> {% endcomment %}

         {% comment %} {{displayed}} {% endcomment %}


Arcitechture 

Route: "/" >> home.html >>> should take prefix input POST METHOD
then it should redirect to

Route: "/words" >> retrieved.html >>> to SHOW all autocompleted words to choose from for loop should be here 
also here we should have a form to POST chosen words then it should redirect to

Route: "/quote" >>> sentence.html >>> to SHOW generated sentence

All the above routes and relevant htmls are working
now I have to work with my generate_sentence function. It should take a string 
find the keys that contains this string and then proceed to sentence generation
