Racing is a national pastime, 
I soon got accustomed to the Reverend fathers, 
rushing past me to get a bet on at the race track.  
My mate Trev spotted one Reverend father making a big fuss of a horse in the parade ring.  
Amazingly the horse went on to win the next race easily.

We took great interest when we saw the same Reverend father bless another horse in the next race, 
blow me, this horse won too.  Well we were hot on the Reverend father's coat tails for the third race 
and as soon as he patted a horse called Foxy Loxy, we raced off to get the best odds we could with the bookies.

Foxy Loxy was well up with the pace on the first circuit, 
but down the back straight for the second time, Foxy Loxy dropped to the rear.  
Then to our chagrin it dropped dead by the water jump.
